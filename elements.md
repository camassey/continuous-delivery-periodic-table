#Continuous Delivery Elements

The elements of continuous delivery are currently broken down into 8 groups:


- Continuous Integration and Delivery
- Infrastructure
- Metrics
- People and Processes
- Releasing
- Rollback and Recovery
- Testing
- Version Control

Raise an issue if you think these groupings could be improved, **OR** take a look at the lists and suggest some elements, **OR** suggest a short description / further reading link for any elements.
